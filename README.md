# Server Status Client

This project is an Angular application that utilizes Material Design to create a user interface for a server status client. The application displays the availability of known servers and indicates whether each server is up or down. The backend data is hardcoded, placing the core focus on the frontend or client-side development. The primary goal of this project is to emphasize learning and implementing Material Design principles.

## Features

- Display the availability of known servers.
- Indicate if a server is up or down using visual cues.
- Utilize Material Design principles for an enhanced user interface.
